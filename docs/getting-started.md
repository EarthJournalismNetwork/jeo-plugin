# Getting started

## Installing

The JEO plugin is currently pending approval to [WordPress Plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) store.

After activating the plugin, new items will appear on the WordPress dashboard: the **Maps** and **Layers** post types, and the JEO settings page.

## Configuring the plugin

At the JEO settings page, you can configure:

* the default latitude, longitude, and zoom for your maps;
* the [Mapbox API key](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/) that'll be used by the plugin;
* the geocoder that'll be used by the plugin -- currently only [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/) is available.
